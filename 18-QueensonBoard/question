Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. Each test case contains integers N and M on the first line. The following N lines contain M characters each representing the board. A '#' represents a blocked square and a '.' represents an unblocked square.

Output:
Output T lines containing the required answer for each test case. As the answers can be really large, output them modulo 1000000007.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= M <= 5

You need to implement a versioned stack, i.e. version of stack will
increment after each push/pop. Apart from push/pop, implement a method
print(n) which would print stack state corresponding to version
'n'. For example:
-> initially stack is empty.
-> Version 1: 11 is pushed
-> Version 2: 8 is pushed
-> version 3: pop. only 11 left
-> Version 4: 15 is pushed
....
And so on.
Print(n) should print state at version 'n'.
Here 1 should print 11, 2 should print 8, 11...
All methods should be as efficient as possible.

There is an array of size 50 that is expected to contain all the numbers from 1 to 50
(every number occuring only once). But there is one number in the array that does not
satisfy this condition i.e. one number is either duplicate or outside 1 to 50 range. 
Find the correct number that is missing in the array.. O(n) soln required.
